## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical bike rental data from Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare system (2011â€“2012) to identify patterns and build predictive models for daily rental counts. The goal is to understand how environmental and seasonal factors influence demand and recommend optimal strategies for bike allocation.

## Dataset Overview
### Source
- **Dataset**: [Capital Bikeshare System (2011-2012)](https://d3ilbixij3aepc.cloudfront.net/projects/CDS-Capstone-Projects/PROP-1018-BikeRental.zip)


### Key Attributes
- **Temporal**: `dteday` (date), `season`, `mnth`, `weekday`, `hr` (hourly data only).  
- **Weather**: `temp` (normalized temperature), `hum` (humidity), `windspeed`, `weathersit` (weather condition).  
- **Usage Metrics**: `casual` (non-registered users), `registered`, `cnt` (total rentals).  

### Files
- **Daily Data**: `day.csv` (731 records, 16 features).  
- **Hourly Data**: `hour.csv` (17,379 records, 17 features).

## Tasks and Objectives
1. **Data Analysis Report**:  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, outliers, and correlations.  
   - Seasonal and weather impact assessment on rental demand.  

2. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Regression models to forecast daily bike rentals (`cnt`).  
   - Comparison of linear models (Ridge, Lasso) and tree-based models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).  

3. **Challenges Report**:  
   - Solutions for multicollinearity, outliers, and non-normality in data.

## Key Methodologies
### Data Preprocessing
- **Outlier Handling**: Capping extreme values in `hum` and `windspeed` at 1st/99th percentiles.  
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Log transformation for `windspeed`.  
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables (`season`, `weathersit`).  
- **Multicollinearity Mitigation**: Removed redundant features (e.g., `temp` vs. `atemp`).  

### Model Development
- **Algorithms Tested**:  
  - Linear Regression, Ridge/Lasso Regression.  
  - XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RÂ², RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation.

## Results and Model Comparison
### Top Performers
| Model          | RÂ² (Test) | RMSE   | Interpretability |  
|----------------|-----------|--------|------------------|  
| **Ridge**      | 0.832     | 819.62 | High             |  
| **XGBoost**    | 0.860     | 748.11 | Low              |  

### Key Insights
1. **Demand Drivers**:  
   - Temperature (`atemp`) and clear weather increase rentals.  
   - Adverse weather (e.g., snow) reduces demand by ~2,149 rentals/day.  
2. **Seasonality**:  
   - Peak demand in fall/winter (6,000+ rentals/day).  
   - 50% YoY growth from 2011 to 2012.

## Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge                  | Solution                              |  
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
| Multicollinearity          | Removed redundant features (VIF analysis). |  
| Outliers in `windspeed`    | Log transformation and capping.       |
